<h1> Dextrous_Antagonistic_robotic_finger ðŸ¤– ðŸ¤ž </h1>
- This is a project on which I worked with two other students as part of a case study that was part of our curriculum. In this project, we coded to show the optimum motion of the 2-link robot.

- As the finger has 2 links we can consider it as 2 link robot. Here we build the model using Newton's Euler method kinematics equations to generate the trajectory and then used 
SQP(Non_linear optimization) technique to optimize the trajectory.
